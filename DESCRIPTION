Title: miRNAtap: microRNA Targets - Aggregated Predictions
Version: 0.99.5
Date: 2014-08-20
Author: Maciej Pajak, Ian Simpson
Maintainer: Maciej Pajak <m.pajak@sms.ed.ac.uk>
Description: The package facilitates implementation of workflows requiring
    miRNA predictions, it allows to integrate ranked miRNA target predictions
    from multiple sources available online and aggregate them with various
    methods which improves quality of predictions above any of the single
    sources. Currently predictions are available for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus
    and Rattus norvegicus (the last one through homology translation).
